Oh so bad! Bad Coder Bad!


In this case we are trying to exemplify bad coding practices. The intention was to create a project full of flaws
so a candidate could fork the repo and fix as many as the can find. We would use this as an interview test to 
determine a C++ developers skill level. 

If you find bad code in here, it's on purpose. We really tried hard to make this bad code.
